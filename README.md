Design and develop a responsive website for a company revamp (real or fictional) or a fictional company site of your own

Chosen company/product to promote among us

# Major commit 2

## Made index.html responsive (mobile friendly)

Background (to be replaced) did not cover the whole page, disappearing when screen size was too small
Now background fits to all screens (i think)

Navbar now becomes smaller when screen is smaller, replacing subpages with a burger (overlay to be added)

## Made some changes to the nav bar

The navbar now brings users to the separate pages (they are still empty)
All links in the nav bar are working.
