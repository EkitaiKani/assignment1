# Assignment 1

Design and develop a responsive website for a company revamp (real or fictional) or a fictional company site of your own
Chosen company/product to promote among us (big mistake)

#### Oops

fixed nav bar to work on mobile for all pages (now all pages have burger)
Also a side note i made the about page look better(?)

# Major commit 3

Made the nav bar work for mobile, added overlay for burger (drop down overlay)

#### Added javascript file for the burger

## About page

added some assets to the about page
now has 3 sections: 1 main title, crewmate and imposter roles

# Major commit 2

## Made index.html responsive (mobile friendly)

Background (to be replaced) did not cover the whole page, disappearing when screen size was too small
Now background fits to all screens (i think)

Navbar now becomes smaller when screen is smaller, replacing subpages with a burger (overlay to be added)

## Made some changes to the nav bar

The navbar now brings users to the separate pages (they are still empty)
All links in the nav bar are working.

# Major Commit 1

## Added the nav bar:

3 menu buttons that directs user to 3 different subpages (to be added)
logos that bring user to social media pages

###### Made some changes to the nav bar:

Added clickable logo and subpages
changed the font
